# PKs Themes
This extension includes PKs theme for Visual Studio Code.

This was the old theme I was tough to code with at college in 2000. It's a high
contrast theme primarily using reds with a mix of blues. I feel most would look
in horror at this theme, but it's how my brain thinks.

## Installation

Install directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PKsThemes"
4. Click Install

Alternatively, install from the command line:
```bash
code --install-extension pkkid.pksthemes
```

## Development

To develop or customize this extension:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Make your changes to the theme files in the `themes/` directory

## Credits

Also thanks to jdinhify for the VSCode editor theme colors.
